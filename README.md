# thorlabs_kenesis_python
Simple script for controlling a linear stage with Python and the Thorlabs Kinesis .NET library
Thorlabs has a new kinesis library to replace their legacy APT library. I wanted to program with Python so used pythonnet to import and use the Thorlabs library.
## Requirements:
1. Python (I used 3.6)
2. Python for .NET https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet
3. Thorlabs Kenesis (I used 32bit for 32 bit systems)
## Hardware:
I used Windows 7 32 bit with Python 3.6 and the 32 bit Thorlabs system for 32 bit systems. I assume that it works with other combinations but it has not been tested.
I have three LTS300 Thorlab stages in X, Y, Z arrangment connected directly to the computer USB.
## Usage:
This is an example script so ack the code for your purposes.
Disclaimer: While this code works it was the first time I had used Python for .net. Use it to get started but not as a template for best practices.
